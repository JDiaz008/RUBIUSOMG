<h4>Rubius began playing Minecraft in the early years of his channel, around 2012, when the game was just beginning to gain worldwide popularity. His videos were notable for their humor, improvisation, and unexpected situations that entertained his followers. He participated in multiplayer servers with friends like Vegetta777, Willyrex, Mangel, and Alexby, but one of his most memorable moments was his participation in Karmaland, a roleplay and adventure server where YouTubers created stories, missions, and events within the world of Minecraft. Thanks to Karmaland and his other series, Rubius helped popularize Minecraft in Spain and Latin America, consolidating his position as one of the game's most influential figures in the Spanish-speaking community. Although he eventually diversified his content into other titles like Fortnite and GTA V, Minecraft and Karmaland will always be remembered as pillars of his success and his connection with millions of fans.</h4>
